# simple_crud
This is a simple PYTHON database package that allows user to manipulate data (create, read, update and delete) using sql statement queries. The user won't have to write the whole sql statement, just call the function associated with the statement query, provide arguments and will be executed for them. 

# Database 
This package is built using the sqlite3 (as this is the dbms provided when downloading python) and currently can be used with it. 

# Troubleshooting the URL-SHortner project:
Should any issues arise while running the programme: ~ Use the issues board on github for the project you have issues with, you can assign me and I will comment back as soon as I get the time.
